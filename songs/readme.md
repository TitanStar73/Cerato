# Add more songs in here!! 

I had to remove most for copyright reasons, that being said I've added a couple of free to use songs.

How to add in more songs:

1. Create a .wav file with your song name (exactly as you would like it to be displayed). E.g. I might name it `Cerato.wav` -> This is displayed as `Cerato` in the video editor.
2. Create a split file called `Cerato.wav.txt` (or the equivalent name + `.txt`). In this you should add the 'split points' in the form `3.2,21.3` This will start the main edit at `3.2` seconds and end it at `21.3`. The remaining part of the song will be used as for the hook/outro
